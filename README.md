# DiscoverArtists

A reccomendation engine made with React and the Spotify API

## How it Works

Login to the web application using spotify and type any desired artist using the dynamic search. 

Once you find the artist you are looking for click on the image/picture to be taken to a page with reccomendations.

Click on the Spotify icon to open the spotify application (if one is available) and navigate to the respective artists Spotify page
